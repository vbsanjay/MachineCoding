# Chess Tournament
- Implement “Chess Tournament”.
- Given four modules.

# Module 1
- Given the number of players we have to conduct matches in pair we have to create a random method for match.
- If ‘player 1’ wins gave 1 point else gave it to ‘player 2’ 
- if there is a Tie then both ‘player 1 ‘ and ‘player 2’ got 0.5 point.

# Module 2
- if number of players are odd then the last one gets bonus point 1 
- we have to display the winner of each match with both player at every round 
- we have to display score of every player, and we have to assign match according to there score 
- once two player played a match they are not allowed to play match in the same pair 
- we have to display the winner of the “Chess Tournament” and also the cumulative score (bonus points are not allowed to add)
